                <h1>New features of iOS 16.</h1>
                <h3>By John Smith</h3>
                <p id="p">
                    The new features of iOS 16 were revealed during June's WWDC event. One of the main features is the
                    ability to personalise the lockscreen with customisable font styles and widgets. You can now create
                    different lock screen styles and switch between them. Widgets like the weather, time, battery levels
                    and upcoming calendar events will allow you to get information at a glance without opening your
                    phone.
                    <br><br>
                    Notifications now stay out of the way by appearing at the bottom of the screen. Changes have been
                    made to Messages. You can now edit sent messages or unsend a message. Recently deleted messages can
                    be recovered up to 30 days after deleting them. Messages can now be marked as unread for when you
                    don't have time to respond but want to come back to it later on.
                    <br><br>
                    The health app has a new medication feature to help you manage and track your medication. iPhone
                    users can now use the fitness app without an apple watch to track and meet their fitness goals. It
                    uses the iPhone's motion sensors to count your steps and calculate an estimate of your calories to
                    contribute to your daily Move goal.
                    <br><br>
                    The Notes app is getting some new features like the ability to create Quick Note in any app from the
                    share menu. You can also now lock your notes with your iPhone passcode. Hidden and recently deleted
                    albums in photos will be locked by default so only you can unlock it with your passcode. Live text
                    is coming to videos. Text can now be interacted with in paused videos. You can copy, paste, look up
                    or translate text in a video.
                    <br><br>
                    iOS 16 will be released sometime in September.
